For years, R users have been known for their knack for analytical thinking, not
necessarily for their expertise in technical infrastructure. Terms like virtual
machines (VMs) and Docker might have seemed like the domain of software

ggplots. But as the complexity of data science workflows has grown, the ability
to manage environments, ensure reproducibility, and collaborate effectively has
become critical. Thatâ€™s where Docker comes in.
