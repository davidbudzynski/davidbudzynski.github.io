I recently had to write some documentation for people who are not familiar with
C++ but know other programming languages and understand the basics of working
inside notebooks. I thought to myself that org mode could be a good tool for
this, as it can compile the code and put the output right next to it in an HTML
or PDF format.

## What is Org Mode

[Org mode][1] is a major mode for [GNU Emacs][2]. It is used for keeping notes,
maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and authoring documents with a fast
and effective plain-text system. It is also an authoring system with unique
support for literate programming and reproducible research. It is a simple
markup language that can be exported to HTML, PDF, and other formats. It is a
much more powerful version of markdown.
