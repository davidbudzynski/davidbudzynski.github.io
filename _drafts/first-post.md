## My experiences with Windows and Linux as a child

For the majority of people born in the late '90s, Windows was the first operating system we came across. This statement is also true in my case. I remember receiveing my first PC when I was 8 years old. It came with a 15 inch CRT screen which weight a ton, 2GB of RAM, and an Intel CPU. This PC was running Windows XP and I honestly loved it. As a young child I was fascinted with computers and technology in general. I remember upgrading its components, as well up upgrading the operating system itself. I experiened using Windows Vista and Windows 7 and didn't have much issues Windows. Proggress made in computing around that time was so large, that each year computers were getting better and better. This meant that not all software was wokrking as fast and seamless as I wished it worked on my old machine. I never through this could also be down to an operating system becasue I didn't know that there were alternatives to Windows untill I stumbled upon an artictle in a technology magazine I was buying each month. It introduced me to Linux and its distributions: Ubuntu and Open SUSE. I tried to install SUSE on my old PC but I didn't succeed. I can't remember what went wrong but perhaps my hardware wasn't compatible, as it wasn't as easy as it is now to get Linux running on any hardware. I abandoned the idea of running Linux and I got a new laptop to use, which came with Windows 7 and worked fine enough to be able to communicate with my friends and do schoolwork. 

## Interactions with macOS in college 

When I went to college I didn't have much money so I bought a cheap windows laptop which did the job. I have screwed it up by spilling beer on it, which resulted in fried logicboard and me nearly losing my college assigment work. This was a great opportunity to build a much better spec PC so I bought all the coponents and built my first computer, which in theory was able to run macOS (and become a hackintosh) - though that happened much later. I installed Windows 10 on it and I was happy although I became more aware about embeded telemetry and privacy concerns expressed by other people on the Internet. 
Around that time I bought my first iPhone and I immediately fell in love with it. I decided to try out one of the iMacs in the university library and I decided to give a hackintosh route a try. Somehow I managed to get it installed and i could tell that macOS was much more polished that Windows, which made me not want to touch Windows ever again. I also bought a MacBook which I still regard as a great machine.

## My gripes with macOS

I think macOS is a great OS for an *average* user. It gets unnecessarily complicated any time you want more control or you want to do something your way instead of Apple way of doing things. Because macOS doesn't come with any package manager, you need to rely on very slow homebrew. Everything you download and want to install needs to be approved time after time. There is also no easy way to bootstrap your development environment in an easy way (tweaking system settings on a new machine etc).
