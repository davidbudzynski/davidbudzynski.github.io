# David Budzynski's Blog

This is the source code of my personal blog [https://davidbudzynski.github.io/](https://davidbudzynski.github.io/).
It's a simple Jekyll-powered site, that I deploy on GitHub pages.

Feel free to send PRs addressing typos, bad grammar, visual glitches, etc.

To run the site locally, you need to have Ruby installed. Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --open-url --livereload --drafts
```

To update all gems within the project, run (assuming you have Bundler
installed):

```bash
bundle update
```
