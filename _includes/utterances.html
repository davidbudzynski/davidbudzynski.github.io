<!-- 
    check this link for how to use utterances: each github repo has to be set up
    initially when using utterances, so keep that in mind for any new projects

    The label argument takes only lables which are already created in the github
    repo. comment is not a default label, so it has to be created in the github
    repo first

    some of the code below is also inspired by the following link:
    https://gist.github.com/mwt/7b747b45d5e28e7a943490d7a3b8a4ff

    It didn't initially work for me, but I think it was because I didn't have
    the the _layouts/post.html file set up correctly. I had to add it. If you
    don't have this file you need to create it with the existing html for your
    current theme. I use the default one (minima) so I just copied the html from
    here:
    https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/38a84a949f9753c4542e25f422935f59b4913053/_layouts/post.html

    and replaced the disquss code with the utterances code My actual title page
    contains got each post is the title followed by " | David Budzynski's Blog",
    so to make github issues title cleaner, I decided to remove the main title
    of the blog  and prepend it with "Comments: " so it looks nicer and it more
    intuitive to me.

    If you do not want to have the _layouts/post.html file, you can just add the
    ruby code to add comments to the bottom of each post. I think it's better to
    have the _layouts/post.html file because it's cleaner and more organized,
    but removing it is an option.
