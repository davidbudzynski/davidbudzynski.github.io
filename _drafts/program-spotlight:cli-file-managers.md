While graphical file managers dominate desktop workflows, **command-line
interface (CLI) file managers** remain indispensable tools for developers,
system administrators, and command-line enthusiasts. They offer unparalleled
speed, flexibility, and efficiency, particularly in environments where graphical
user interfaces are unavailable or unnecessary.

Among the diverse options available, **Yazi** and **Midnight Commander (MC)**
stand out as two of the most interesting choices for very different reasons. In
this article, we’ll explore their features and delve into why **Midnight
Commander** is a particularly powerful ally for handling complex tasks.


## Why Use a CLI File Manager?

CLI file managers are more than simple directory navigation tools. They offer
unique advantages, such as:

- **Efficiency**: No GUI overhead, just fast file management.
- **Remote Accessibility**: Perfect for managing files over SSH or managing
  servers without a graphical interface.
- **Batch Operations**: CLI tools simplify repetitive tasks like moving,
  copying, or renaming multiple files.
- **Customizability**: Tailor them to fit your workflow seamlessly.


## Yazi: Sleek and Modern with a Familiar Twist

**Yazi** is a relatively new CLI file manager that has quickly gained attention
for its minimalistic yet powerful design. It combines traditional CLI speed with
modern usability, borrowing design ideas from graphical environments. For those
who used ranger or nnn, Yazi will feel familiar.

### Key Features of Yazi:

1. **Keyboard-Driven Navigation**: Yazi is designed for users who prefer a
   keyboard-centric workflow, making navigation fast and intuitive.
2. **Nested Directory View**: One standout feature of Yazi is the way it
   visually displays nested directories. This approach is akin to the column
   view in macOS Finder, allowing you to see multiple levels of the directory
   structure at once. This feature makes it easy to understand your filesystem's
   hierarchy and move quickly between deeply nested folders.
3. **Fuzzy Searching**: Locating files is a breeze with Yazi’s intelligent,
   fuzzy search system, perfect for sprawling file systems.
4. **Lightweight and Cross-Platform**: Yazi is highly portable and works
   seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
5. **Customization**: Its configuration system allows users to adapt Yazi to
   their workflows with custom keybindings and actions.

### When to Use Yazi:

If you’re seeking a **modern CLI experience with a familiar visual
representation of directories**, Yazi excels. Its columnar view of nested
directories is particularly useful for users accustomed to graphical file
managers like macOS Finder, while its lightweight design ensures it stays true
to CLI principles. My use case for Yazi is when I need to quickly navigate
through directories and preview files or pictures without opening them.


## Midnight Commander: A Timeless Workhorse

**Midnight Commander (MC)** has stood the test of time, remaining a favorite
among CLI enthusiasts for decades. With its **dual-pane interface**, extensive
features, and powerful batch operation capabilities, MC is an indispensable tool
for handling complex workflows.

### Key Features of Midnight Commander:

1. **Dual-Pane Interface**: Allows for side-by-side directory views, making
   tasks like copying and moving files effortless.
2. **Virtual Filesystem Support**: Access remote servers via SFTP, FTP, or work
   directly within archives like `.zip` or `.tar.gz` as if they were normal
   directories.
3. **Integrated Tools**: Midnight Commander includes built-in file viewers and
   editors, enabling quick inspection or modification of files without leaving
   the tool (if that's something you prefer).
4. **Search and Batch Operations**: Its robust search and scripting capabilities
   make it ideal for managing large numbers of files.
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Like Yazi, MC runs on Linux, macOS, and
   Windows.


## My Experience: Why Midnight Commander Stands Out

While Yazi impresses with its modern approach and innovative directory views,
**Midnight Commander shines in practical, real-world tasks**. Here are some ways
MC has proved invaluable:

1. **Managing Files Across Multiple Folders**: The **dual-pane interface** is a
   game-changer. When working on a project requiring assets from various
   locations, I can easily view, compare, and move files without repeatedly
   switching directories.
2. **Copying Bulk Files**: MC’s straightforward copy and move operations make
   transferring large numbers of files painless.
3. **Accessing Remote Servers**: The ability to work directly with remote
   filesystems through SFTP has saved me hours of time when managing servers.
4. **Popularity**: Midnight Commander is a well-established tool with a large
   community, ensuring that you can find help and resources easily. There are
   many plugins and scripts available to extend its functionality as well as
   alternative applications which are based on Midnight Commander dual-pane
   interface.


## Yazi vs. Midnight Commander: A Quick Comparison

| **Feature**               | **Yazi**                     | **Midnight Commander**           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Interface**             | Single-pane, nested view (like macOS Finder) | Dual-pane, traditional layout   |
| **Ease of Use**           | Intuitive, modern           | Requires some learning curve     |
| **Customization**         | Highly configurable         | Extensive, though less modern    |
| **Batch Operations**      | Limited                    | Excellent                        |
| **Remote Filesystem Access** | Not built-in              | Fully supported                  |
| **Best For**              | Minimalism, quick navigation | Complex tasks, remote access     |


## Conclusion: Why Midnight Commander Takes the Crown

While **Yazi** offers an innovative CLI experience with its macOS-inspired
nested directory view and streamlined design, **Midnight Commander remains the
more versatile and practical choice** for everyday workflows.

Its **dual-pane interface** is unparalleled for tasks involving multiple
directories, such as copying files or reorganizing projects. Features like
remote filesystem access and batch operations make MC a powerful tool for
developers, sysadmins, and anyone managing a large number of files. For these
reasons, **Midnight Commander remains my go-to file manager for day-to-day
tasks**. 

Yazi’s minimalist and modern approach might suit users with simpler needs, but
when the workload gets heavy, Midnight Commander’s depth and reliability make it
an indispensable tool.
