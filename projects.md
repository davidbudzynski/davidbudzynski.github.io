Here are some of the projects I've worked on in my free time. I've included a
brief description of each project, and a link to the repository where you can
find the code.

## [R-project-bootstrap](https://github.com/davidbudzynski/R-project-bootstrap)

This is a simple R project template repository that I use to start new R
projects. It includes Dockerfile, Makefile, directory structure, and a few other
things that I find useful. It's inspired by on the [Cookiecutter Data Science
template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/), but I've
made a few changes to suit my own preferences.
