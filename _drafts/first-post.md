## Interactions with other operating systems

Since my childhood, I used many differet versions of Microsoft Windows. When I went to college I didn't have much money so I bought a cheap windows laptop which did the job. I have screwed it up by spilling beer on it, which resulted in fried logicboard and me nearly losing my college assigment work. This was a great opportunity to build a much better spec PC so I bought all the coponents and built my first computer, which in theory was able to run macOS (and become a hackintosh) - though that happened much later. I installed Windows 10 on it and I was happy although I became more aware about embeded telemetry and privacy concerns expressed by other people on the Internet. 
Around that time I bought my first iPhone and I immediately fell in love with it. I decided to try out one of the iMacs in the university library and I decided to give a hackintosh route a try. Somehow I managed to get it installed and i could tell that macOS was much more polished that Windows, which made me not want to touch Windows ever again. I also bought a MacBook which I still regard as a great machine.

### My gripes with macOS

I think macOS is a great OS for an *average* user. It gets unnecessarily complicated any time you want more control or you want to do something your way instead of Apple way of doing things. Because macOS doesn't come with any package manager, you need to rely on very slow homebrew. Everything you download and want to install needs to be approved time after time. There is also no easy way to bootstrap your development environment in an easy way (tweaking system settings on a new machine etc). To give an example, one week ago my girlfriend asked me to help her install LaTex on her macbook. I though installing it via hombrew will all that's needed. Turns out that once you install it, you need to add it to path manually, which didn't work in my case, and I had to install it by downloading MiKTeX distribution from a website, which solved a problem. And of course any installed that you download form the internet is treated as if it was a high security risk that requires you to confirm that you want to open that file.

## Dipping my feet in Linux

I think I started getting more and more intrigued by using Linux when I picked up web development. I decided to look at different distributions and pick one to run on my old laptop. I remember trying out Ubuntu but I really didn't like GNOME desktop environment, so I decided to give Linux Mint a try. Although my laptop was fairly old and it only had 4GB RAM, it works suprisingly fast. All the tools I needed worked like on any other OS, so I decided to start install it on my hackintosh and dualboot alongside macOS. For that task I picked up Majaro with KDE desktop environment. I liked it so much so that each time I had to choose between macOS and Linux, I'd go for the latter. About a year ago I build a new PC exclusively for Linux so I can do all data science projcts I want on it.
