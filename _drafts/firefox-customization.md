## Firefox's popularity around 2010's

When I was growing up, Firefox was the browser to use. It was the most popular
browser (at lest in Poland), with a market share above 50%. It was fast, secure,
and customizable. It was the browser that you could trust. It was the browser
that you could make your own.

Fast forward to 2024, and Firefox's usage has been declining for years and years
and its users are often seen as a dying breed. But I still use Firefox as my
default browser. Why?

## Customization

Firefox is still the most customizable browser out there. You can change almost
every aspect of it, from the way it looks to the way it behaves. You can make it
look and feel exactly the way you want it to. You can make it yours. It is true
that developers are trying to make it more difficult to customize Firefox, but
it is still possible to do so if you know how.

### About:config

Firefox has a hidden configuration menu called `about:config` that allows you to
change a lot of settings that are not available in the regular settings menu.
Once these settings are changed, they are saved in a file called `prefs.js` in
your profile directory. This file is a simple JavaScript file that you can edit
manually if you want to. If you have a firefox account, it also syncs these
settings across all your devices. These settings allow you to increase your
privacy and security.
